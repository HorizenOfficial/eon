## Notes about new/updated Features

### Forger reward address
For forger nodes: it is now possible to specify a custom address where the block reward will be directed.<br> 
The address will be put inside every new block forged by the node.<br> 
(Previously the first address on the local wallet was taken automatically, without the possibility to specify a different one).<br> 
Any EON address can be specified (included a smart contract address). The private key does not need to be imported in the local wallet.

How to specify it: 
- inside the config file, add a property like this inside the *forger* section:

    forgerRewardAddress = "xxxxxxxxx"

- if using docker, configure the env property SC_NODE_FORGER_REWARD_ADDRESS
