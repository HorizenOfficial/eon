## Notes about new/updated Features
The 1.3.0 version has been updated to the 0.11.0 SDK version, which introduces several additions: refer to [SDK release notes](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sidechains-SDK/blob/0.11.0/doc/release/0.11.0.md) for a detailed explanation.

### Forger reward address
See SDK release notes for an explanation of the feature.
If using docker, you can just configure the env property SCNODE_FORGER_REWARD_ADDRESS: the config file will be automatically generated accordingly.

### Custom log4j file support in docker
If using docker, it is now possible to configure the env property SCNODE_LOG4J_CUSTOM_CONFIG to use a completely custom log4j configuration file. See ['Advanced logging customization'
 section in this help](../howto/customlog.md) for further info. 

 ### Pause forging
Please be aware that starting from this version EON block production may temporarily pause if the mainchain block production slows down: EON forgers will automatically stop to produce new blocks if in the latest 99 EON Blocks no reference to mainchain blocks is present.
