## Notes about new/updated Features
The 1.0.1 version has been updated to the 0.8.1 SDK version, which fixes the eth RPC call eth_gasPrice: it now returns an estimation of the gasPrice more accurate. The previous one was overestimating the minimum gasPrice needed in some corner cases. Following the new endpoint estimation, will be possible to pay lower average fees than before.\
The update will be immediately visible, not requirying an hardfork activation.
